**2 Satisfactory**

This is where I'm going to put homework 1
A regular Latin verb has four principle parts.
The principle part that is the third principle part. The person and number that is used for the third principle part is the third person singular and third person plural.
The principle parts of Faciō are faciō, facere, fec-i, fact-um. The principle parts for Interficiō are interficiō, interficere, interfeci, interfectus. The endings of 1st, 2nd, and 3rd principle parts for Faciō and Interficiō change in the same way.
Two verbs that are in the Fourth Conjugation are audio, audire, audivi, auditus: to hear and venio, venire, veni ventus: to come. The principle parts are very regular other than veni in venio because it doesn't have a "vi" and the end. 
The principle parts for Capio, which are capio, capĕre, cepi, captus: to seize, and Facio, which are facio, facĕre, feci, factus: to make, the changes in their principle parts are similar because in their 2nd principle part they have a macron over the e in "ere" and in their third principle part they have "i" at the end instead of something like "ivi".
